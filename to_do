(X) Exploratory analysis of data
    (X) Spot useless variables
    (X) Consider class distribution
    (X) Look at data statistics

(X) Find a feature that quantifies "how much ink" a digit costs
    (X) Report AVG and STD of feature within each class
    (X) Determine which pairs of classes can be well/hardly distinguished with these statistics

(X) Fit a multinomial logit model using only the "ink feature"
    (X) Evaluate how well this model can distinguish classes ("how well can the model distinguish between the digits 1 and 8?)

(X) Find another feature other than the "ink feature"
    (X) Determine why it might discriminate well between classes

(X) Perform the same analysis for this new feature as you did for the ink feature
    (X) Report AVG and STD of feature within each class
    (X) Determine which pairs of classes can be well/hardly distinguished with these statistics

( ) Fit a multinomial logit model using both features
    ( ) Determine if and how it improves on the single-feature models

( ) Analyze data with 3 classification methods
    (X) Draw sample for training data from dataset
    (X) (Optional) Reduce level of detail (e.g. 14x14) by resizing input
    ( ) Use 3 classification algorithms with different parameters and use cross-validation to select best parameters
        regularized multinomial logit model (using the LASSO penalty)
        support vector machines
        feed-forward neural networks
    ( ) For each classification method, discuss:
        the complexity parameters of the algorithm and how the values were selected
        the estimated accuracy of the best model for that method
    ( ) Use remaining data to estimate accuracy of final selected model for each method

( ) Discuss which classification method(s) produced the best classifier
    ( ) Compare accuracies of models
    ( ) Perform statistical test to find significant differences between the accuracies
